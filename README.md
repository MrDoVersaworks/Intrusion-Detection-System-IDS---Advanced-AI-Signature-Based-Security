Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - Advanced AI & Signature-Based Security
üìå Overview

This is a senior-level, enterprise-grade Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built in C++. It combines the following features:

‚úÖ Real-time Packet Sniffing (libpcap)
‚úÖ Signature-Based Intrusion Detection (Detects SQL injection, DDoS, Port Scanning)
‚úÖ AI-Powered Anomaly Detection (Machine Learning for unknown threats)
‚úÖ Database Logging (PostgreSQL for security event storage)
‚úÖ Kafka Alert System (Distributed security notifications)
‚úÖ Multi-Threading for High Performance

It is optimized for large-scale enterprise security and can run in both cloud and on-premise environments.

üñ•Ô∏è Web-Based Security Monitoring Dashboard

For real-time monitoring, you can use a Flask API + JavaScript dashboard to visualize attack logs.

Run the Web API
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 flask_api.py
Access the Dashboard
Open dashboard.html in a browser to see real-time IDS logs.
üìå Attack Detection Capabilities

Attack Type	Detection Method
SQL Injection	Detects "UNION SELECT" in HTTP traffic
Port Scanning	Identifies rapid SYN packets to multiple ports
DDoS Attack	Flags high traffic volume from a single IP
Malware Traffic	Detects suspicious payload patterns
üìú Example Logs

When an attack is detected, the IDS logs it in the database and sends an alert.

Sample Console Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
[INFO] Packet: 192.168.1.10 -> 8.8.8.8
[ALERT] SQL Injection detected!
[SECURITY EVENT] SQL Injection detected in traffic flow.
[ALERT] AI detected anomaly!
Sample Database Log Entry:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM SecurityLogs;
ID	Timestamp	Event
1	2025-02-01 12:30:22	SQL Injection detected!
2	2025-02-01 12:32:15	AI detected anomaly in traffic.
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

Run this IDS on a dedicated security system to monitor network activity.
Ensure compliance with privacy laws before using it on live networks.
Modify attack signatures in attackSignatures for custom threat detection.
üì¢ Future Enhancements

Full AI Model Integration (Replace placeholder AI with real ML training)
Distributed Deployment (Kubernetes for large-scale monitoring)
Machine Learning Refinement (Improve anomaly detection accuracy)
Cloud-Based Log Analysis (Integrate with AWS Security Hub, SIEM tools)
